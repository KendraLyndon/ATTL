        bio: [
          "Brenda starting writing songs for her own amusement while in high school assuming this was normal and never took her songwriting very seriously until much, much later. Acting and singing was taken seriously starting in middle school, through college, and into her adult years.",
          "Favorite roles during school included Kate Hardcastle in \"She Stoops to Conquor\"; Irene Malloy in \"The Matchmaker\", and Doc in \"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\". She was a member of the North Park University (Chicago) drama gospel team \"Illustrations\" for two years with a summer tour of Eastern and Mid-west states.",
          "After moving to Seattle, she took vocal coaching from Marianne Weltmann and sang one season with the Opus 7 Vocal Ensemble directed by Loren Pontén. Brenda's musical theatre roles have included Miss Minchin in \"A Little Princess\" at Bethany Community Church and productions on the Newport Covenant Church stage in \"Godspell\", \"The Sound of Music\", and \"Fiddler on the Roof\".",
          "In her adulthood, Brenda found that that seed of songwriting had grown deeper and the songs she best loved to write were for musicals. Brenda wrote two songs for the original youth musical \"High Flying Guitars\" with book by Wendy Wiley which was presented at Newport Covenant in 2008.",
          "She partnered with Kathleen Lyndon about 10 years ago to write \"A Time to Live\" which has had three readings and multiple revisions (with many songs relegated to 'the trunk'). In 2013, the song \"Wherever You Go\" from \"A Time to Live\" was selected to be presented at The First Act Feedback Fest in New York, which was sponsored by Theatre Resources Unlimited (TRU) and MusicalWriters.com. It received very favorable and constructive feedback from a panel of industry veterans, including a Tony winner.",
          "Brenda is delighted to see \"A Time to Live\" as a full production and is honored to have this as her directorial premier as well. For the software geeks reading this, Brenda is an experienced software product manager and is applying Agile development principles to the production process of \"A Time to Live\", complete with a Scrum Master (who doubles as Ahaz). Agile, as of this writing, appears to be working exceedingly well in the application of producing a musical!"
